=> The reconciliation process makes React work faster.
Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM.
Important concepts behind the working of the Reconciliation process are:
1.Virtual DOM  
2.Diffing Algorithm

=> In tradition method rendering, DOM has been created and it renders the components even the data is same.
AFTER THAT,
virtual DOM comes in the picture, it helps to create a virual dom and when new changes happen in the code,
then it creates again a new virtual dom 

=> Comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm. The cool fact is all these comparisons take place 
in the memory and nothing is yet changed in the Browser.
called Reconciliation.

=> "This updates the Browser DOM with the least number of
 changes possible without rendering the entire DOM again".

<a</a> -does not used in react because it will reload the whole page
<Link>-used because it will only update the changes on the dom
